# 2D Platformer Controller Unity Package

Welcome to the 2D Platformer Controller Unity Package! This package contains all the necessary assets and scripts to integrate advanced platformer mechanics into your Unity projects seamlessly.

## Contents:

1. **Unity Packages:** 
   - **Built-In (Standard Render Pipeline):** 
     - **File:** `Platformer_Built_In.unitypackage`
     - **Description:** Designed for projects using Unity's Built-In (Standard) Render Pipeline.
   - **Universal Render Pipeline (URP):** 
     - **File:** `Platformer_URP.unitypackage`
     - **Description:** Optimized for projects using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

2. **Source Files:**
   - **Scripts:** 
     - Original script files (`Movement2D.cs` and others) for direct integration into projects.
   - **Sprites:** 
     - Sprite sheets and individual sprite images used in the demo scenes.

## Why Two Packages?

The package comes in two versions to accommodate different rendering pipelines in Unity. The **Built-In (Standard Render Pipeline)** package is suitable for projects using Unity's default rendering pipeline. On the other hand, the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** package is optimized for projects utilizing Unity's URP for better performance and compatibility with URP-specific features.

## How to Use:

### Using the Unity Packages:
1. Choose the appropriate package based on your project's rendering pipeline: **Built-In** or **URP**.
2. Import the selected package (`Platformer_Built_In.unitypackage` or `Platformer_URP.unitypackage`) into your Unity project.
3. Follow the provided documentation to set up and configure the platformer controller.
4. Enjoy the seamless integration of advanced platformer mechanics into your game!

### Using the Source Files:
1. **Scripts:**
   - Navigate to the `Scripts` folder.
   - Copy desired scripts into your Unity project.
2. **Sprites:**
   - Navigate to the `Sprites` folder.
   - Copy sprite sheets and images into your project.
3. Ensure dependencies are resolved and scripts are configured as needed.

**Note:** Importing the Unity package includes all necessary files. Source files are provided for direct integration or exploration purposes. If you've imported the package, there's no need to import the source files separately.

Happy game development!
